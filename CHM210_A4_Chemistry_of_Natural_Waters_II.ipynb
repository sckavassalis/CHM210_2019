    "# CHM210 Assignment 4: Chemistry of Natural Waters, II\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the fourth assignment for CHM210. We are going to use a <a href=\"https://jupyter4edu.github.io/jupyter-edu-book/\">Jupyter notebook</a> with Python to investigate some properties of acid-base solubility in natural waters. All of your answers will be completed within this document (changes you make are saved into your personal https://utoronto.syzygy.ca account, so don't worry about editing this file). There are a lot of free, online resources out there to help you with Jupyter and Python. I recommend Christian Hill's <a href=\"https://scipython.com/book/\">\"Learning Scientific Programming with Python\"</a>. The chemistry content of this assignment should follow your textbook and lecture notes (Chapter 10 in Baird and Cann, 5th edition). If you need to review acid-base equilibria fundamentals, the <a href=\"https://openstax.org/books/chemistry-2e/pages/14-introduction\">openstax Chemistry 2e book</a> is a good, freely accessible online resource that you may want to refer to. \n",
    "\n",
    "After completing this assignment, you should be able to write down acid-base equilibrium constants, calculate pH, solubility, alkalinity, and aqueous concentrations for a given set of reactions at equilibrium with known equilibrium constants, apply Le Chatelier's Principle, and write and test functions in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "First things first, we need to import the Python modules we will be using for this assignment. Press the \"Run\" button (or ctrl-enter) on the box below to import the packages we need. If done successfully, the \"You have imported the above modules!\" text will display below. "
