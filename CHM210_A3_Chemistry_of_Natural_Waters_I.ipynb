    "\n",
    "Welcome to the third assignment for CHM210. We are going to use a <a href=\"https://jupyter4edu.github.io/jupyter-edu-book/\">Jupyter notebook</a> with Python to investigate some properties of natural waters and redox chemistry. All of your answers will be completed within this document (changes you make are saved into your personal https://utoronto.syzygy.ca account, so don't worry about editing this file). There are a lot of free, online resources out there to help you with Jupyter and Python. I recommend Christian Hill's <a href=\"https://scipython.com/book/\">\"Learning Scientific Programming with Python\"</a>. The chemistry content of this assignment should follow your textbook and lecture notes (Chapter 10 in Baird and Cann, 5th edition).\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing this assignment, you should be able to convert between absolute concentrations and mixing ratios in an aqueous environment (this is different than in the gas phase!), work with Henry's law constants, understand what is meant by thermal pollution, describe how the solubility of gases changes with temperature, calculate the pE for a given half reaction, and interpret a pE-pH diagram. You will also gain more familiarity with using Python to perform simple calculations.\n",
