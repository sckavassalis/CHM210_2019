    "\n",
    "Welcome to the second assignment for CHM210. We are going to use a <a href=\"https://jupyter4edu.github.io/jupyter-edu-book/\">Jupyter notebook</a> with Python to investigate some properties of tropospheric chemistry and photochemical smog. All of your answers will be completed within this document (changes you make are saved into your personal https://utoronto.syzygy.ca account, so don't worry about editing this file). There are a lot of free, online resources out there to help you with Jupyter and Python. I recommend Christian Hill's <a href=\"https://scipython.com/book/\">\"Learning Scientific Programming with Python\"</a>. The chemistry content of this assignment should follow your textbook and lecture notes, but for those wanting additional materials, Daniel Jacob's <a href=\"http://acmg.seas.harvard.edu/people/faculty/djj/book/\">\"Introduction to Atmospheric Chemistry\"</a> is freely available online and has a couple relevant chapters for this assignment (Ch11. <a href=\"http://acmg.seas.harvard.edu/people/faculty/djj/book/bookchap11.html#pgfId=998914\">\"Oxidizing Power of the Troposphere</a> and Ch12. <a href=\"http://acmg.seas.harvard.edu/people/faculty/djj/book/bookchap12.html#pgfId=147850\">\"Ozone Air Pollution\"</a>).\n",

    "Your textbook discusses several strategies in chapter 3. Air quality standards aimed at reducing ozone precursor emissions (NOx, CO, and VOCs) have encouraged the use and increased efficiency of catalytic convertors in vehicles. Changes in additives to gasoline have resulted in decreased tailpipe CO emissions (see pages 94-97 in your text book). NOx control strategies for powerplants include reduced flaming temperatures, staged fuel combustion, stack catalytic converters, and wet scrubbing og exhaust gases (pages 98-99). VOC emissions from organic solvents have also been targeted (pages 101-103). \n",
    "\n",
    "While reductions in precursor emissions and precursor concentrations are seen throughout urban areas in the developed world, ozone concentrations are often stagnant (and in some places increasing). This is because of the non-linearity in the chemistry as seen above. Simultaneous reductions of NOx and VOC/CO emissions can lead to no change in the ozone production rate if those reductions track a single curve on the ozone production isopleth. "
