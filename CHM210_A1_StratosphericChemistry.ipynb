    "# CHM210 Assignment 1: Stratospheric Chemistry\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the first assignment for CHM210. We are going to use a <a href=\"https://jupyter4edu.github.io/jupyter-edu-book/\">Jupyter notebook</a> with Python to investigate some properties of stratospheric chemistry and the ozone layer. All of your answers will be completed within this document (changes you make are saved into your personal https://utoronto.syzygy.ca account, so don't worry about editing this file). There are a lot of free, online resources out there to help you with Jupyter and Python. I recommend Christian Hill's <a href=\"https://scipython.com/book/\">\"Learning Scientific Programming with Python\"</a>. The chemistry content of this assignment should follow your textbook and lecture notes, but for those wanting additional materials, Daniel Jacob's <a href=\"http://acmg.seas.harvard.edu/people/faculty/djj/book/\">\"Introduction to Atmospheric Chemistry\"</a> is freely available online and has several relevant chapters for this assignment (Ch1. <a href=\"http://acmg.seas.harvard.edu/people/faculty/djj/book/bookchap1.html#pgfId=518053\">\"Measures of Atmospheric Composition</a>, Ch2. <a href=\"http://acmg.seas.harvard.edu/people/faculty/djj/book/bookchap2.html#pgfId=496461\">\"Atmospheric Pressure\"</a>,  and Ch10. <a href=\"http://acmg.seas.harvard.edu/people/faculty/djj/book/bookchap10.html#pgfId=46289\">\"Stratospheric Ozone\"</a>).\n",
