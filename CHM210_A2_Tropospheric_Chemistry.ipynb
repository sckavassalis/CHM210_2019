    "# CHM210 Assignment 2: Tropospheric Chemistry\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the second assignment for CHM210. We are going to use a <a href=\"https://jupyter4edu.github.io/jupyter-edu-book/\">Jupyter notebook</a> with Python to investigate some properties of tropospheric chemistry and photochemical smog. All of your answers will be completed within this document (changes you make are saved into your personal https://utoronto.syzygy.ca account, so don't worry about editing this file). There are a lot of free, online resources out there to help you with Jupyter and Python. I recommend Christian Hill's <a href=\"https://scipython.com/book/\">\"Learning Scientific Programming with Python\"</a>. The chemistry content of this assignment should follow your textbook and lecture notes, but for those wanting additional materials, Daniel Jacob's <a href=\"http://acmg.seas.harvard.edu/people/faculty/djj/book/\">\"Introduction to Atmospheric Chemistry\"</a> is freely available online and has a couple relevant chapters for this assignment (Ch11. <a href=\"http://acmg.seas.harvard.edu/people/faculty/djj/book/bookchap11.html#pgfId=998914\">\"Oxidizing Power of the Troposphere</a> and Ch12. <a href=\"http://acmg.seas.harvard.edu/people/faculty/djj/book/bookchap12.html#pgfId=147850\">\"Ozone Air Pollution\"</a>).\n",

    "After completing this assignment, you should be able to explain and understand the major processes responsible for producing photochemical smog (ozone pollution) and describe the challenges involved in ozone control. \n",
